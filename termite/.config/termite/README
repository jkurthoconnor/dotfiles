If working on remote systems (via ssh) cause problems with editors, update the remote system's terminfo database with the details for termite.

Option 1 (quick workaround):

  - execute on remote system:
    - `export TERM=xterm-color`

Option 2 (suggested by termite developers):

  - form remote system, download the source:
    - `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thestinger/termite/master/termite.terminfo`

  - compile and update database:
    - `tic -x termite.terminfo`

Option 3:

  - locally dump terminal info into a file:
    - `infocmp xterm-termite > xterm-termite.terminfo`

  - copy info source to remote system

  - compile and update database on remote system
    - `tic termite.terminfo`
